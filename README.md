# FileSplitter
Tiny project I developed in college just after learning java, almost 6 years back.
The purpose of this project then was to add something to the resume.
After 4 years of being a professional developer, I found this project somewhere hidden in my laptop.
Needless to say I was a bit embarassed to see the single page code that I used to write.
So I decided to refactor the code and improve the design part. The core logic of splitting and joining the files is very basic.
So the purpose is just to improve the design and learn how to use github.
